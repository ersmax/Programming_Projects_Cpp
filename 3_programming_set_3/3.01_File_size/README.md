A megabyte is 8000 kilobits. Write a program that will read in the bit rate in kilobits
per second and the duration in minutes of a video clip and will output the file
size of the video clip in megabytes.
Define a function to compute the file size of the video clip. Your program should
use a globally defined constant for the number of kilobits per megabyte.

=================================================================================

The program does the following:

- It defines a megabyte as 8000 kilobits, establishing the conversion factor for calculations.
- The program must prompt the user to input two values:
  - Bit rate (in kilobits per second)
  - Duration (in minutes) of a video clip
- The program calculates the file size in megabytes using these inputs.
- The calculation should be performed in a separate function for modularity and clarity.
- A global constant is required for the number of kilobits per megabyte
