On a popular television dance show, each contestant is given scores based on 4
parameters: technicality, expression, stage utilization, and the energy level of the
contestant. The jury of 3 judges award scores of 1 to 10 against each parameter, with
10 being the highest. All the scores given by a judge are summed up and averaged
against the scores given by the other judges to obtain each contestant’s final score.
Write a computer program that inputs scores given by each judge against all the
parameters and calculates the overall score obtained by a contestant. The program
should ensure that all inputs are within the allowable data ranges.
