/*
The standard deviation of a list of numbers is a measure of how much the numbers
deviate from the average. If the standard deviation is small, the numbers are
clustered close to the average. If the standard deviation is large, the numbers are
scattered far from the average. The standard deviation, S, of a list of N numbers xi
is defined as follows:
S = sqrt ( sum from i=1 to N of (xi - X)^2 / N ),
where X is the average of the N numbers x1, x2, … .
Define a function that takes a
partially filled array of numbers as its argument and returns the standard deviation
of the numbers in the partially filled array. Since a partially filled array requires two
arguments, the function will actually have two formal parameters: an array parameter
