Buoyancy is the ability of an object to float. Archimedes’ Principle states that the
buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid that is displaced by the submerged
object. The buoyant force can be computed by
Fb = V * g
where Fb is the buoyant force, V is the volume of the submerged object, and g is
the specific weight of the fluid. If Fb is greater than or equal to the weight of the
object, then it will float, otherwise it will sink.
Write a program that inputs the weight (in pounds) and radius (in feet) of a sphere
and outputs whether the sphere will sink or float in water. Use g = 62.4 lb/ft3 as
the specific weight of water. The volume of a sphere is computed by (4/3)pr3.

==============================================================================

This program determines if a sphere will float or sink in water using Archimedes’ Principle.

It prompts the user for the sphere’s weight (in pounds) and radius (in feet),
calculates the sphere’s volume, then computes the buoyant force using the specific
weight of water (62.4 lb/ft³).

If the buoyant force is greater than or equal to the sphere’s weight,
it outputs that the sphere will float; otherwise, it will sink.
