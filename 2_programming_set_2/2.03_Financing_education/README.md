An organization intends to get people to sponsor the education of underprivileged
children. As part of their program, they launch a website where people can register
by entering their details and the amount (in USD) they wish to sponsor each
month. The website calculates the number of children the donor can sponsor based
on the amount required to educate one child.
Write a program that inputs the amount required for one child’s education, and
the amount a person is willing to sponsor, and calculates how many children
can be sponsored by that person. The program should also print how much of
the person’s amount is remaining after calculating the number of children, and
suggest how many more dollars would educate another child. (Hint: Use a do
while loop)

==============================================================================

This program helps an organization determine how many underprivileged
children a donor can sponsor based on the amount they wish to contribute
and the cost of educating one child.

Features:
- Prompts the user for:
  - The amount required to educate one child.
  - The total amount the donor wishes to sponsor.
- Calculates:
  - The maximum number of children that can be sponsored.
  - The remaining amount after sponsoring as many children as possible.
  - The additional amount needed to sponsor one more child.
- Uses a loop (as per the hint) to demonstrate the calculation process.

Note:
The program ensures accurate calculation and avoids narrowing conversion warnings
by casting types appropriately.
