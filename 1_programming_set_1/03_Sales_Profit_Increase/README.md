An electronics company sees a 13% increase in sales from the previous year, making
27% more profit than the previous work. Write a program that takes the company’s
previous year’s sales and profit in millions as input and outputs the increase in sales
and profit in millions from the previous year. Use a variable declaration with the
modifier const to express the sales and profit increase.

Program Description
This program calculates the increase in sales and profit for an electronics company,
given its previous year’s financial performance. The company expects a 13% increase
in sales and a 27% increase in profit compared to the prior year.

How it Works:
The user enters:
- Previous year’s sales (in millions of dollars).
- Previous year’s profit (in millions of dollars).

The program uses predefined constants to represent the percentage increases:
- SALES_INCREASE_PERC = 0.13 (13% sales growth).
- PROFIT_INCREASE_PERC = 0.27 (27% profit growth).

It multiplies the previous values by the respective percentages to compute
the expected increases.
The program outputs the increase in both sales and profit, expressed
in millions of dollars.

Key Features:
- Uses const variables for sales and profit growth rates.
- Outputs the increase amounts (not the new totals).
- Keeps monetary values in millions for clarity and consistency.
