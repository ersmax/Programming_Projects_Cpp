Negotiating a consumer loan is not always straightforward. One form of loan is the
discount installment loan, which works as follows. Suppose a loan has a face value
of $1,000, the interest rate is 15%, and the duration is 18 months. The interest is
computed by multiplying the face value of $1,000 by 0.15, yielding $150. That
figure is then multiplied by the loan period of 1.5 years to yield $225 as the total
interest owed. That amount is immediately deducted from the face value, leaving
the consumer with only $775. Repayment is made in equal monthly installments
based on the face value. So the monthly loan payment will be $1,000 divided by 18,
which is $55.56. This method of calculation may not be too bad if the consumer
needs $775, but the calculation is a bit more complicated if the consumer needs
$1,000. Write a program that will take three inputs: the amount the consumer needs
to receive, the interest rate, and the duration of the loan in months. The program
should then calculate the face value required in order for the consumer to receive
the amount needed. It should also calculate the monthly payment.

===================================================================
This program calculates the required face value and monthly payment for a discount installment loan.
The user is prompted to enter the amount they need to receive,
the annual interest rate (as a percentage), and the loan duration in months.

The program computes the face value so that, after the interest is deducted upfront,
the user receives the desired amount.

It then calculates the monthly payment by dividing the face value by the number of months.
Results are displayed with two decimal places for clarity.

This helps users understand the actual cost and payment structure of a discount installment loan.
