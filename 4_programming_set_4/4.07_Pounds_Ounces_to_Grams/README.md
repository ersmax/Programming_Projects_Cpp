Write a program that will read a weight in pounds and ounces and will output
the equivalent weight in kilograms and grams. Use at least three functions: one
for input, one or more for calculating, and one for output. Include a loop that lets
the user repeat this computation for new input values until the user says he or she
wants to end the program. There are 2.2046 pounds in a kilogram, 1000 grams in
a kilogram, and 16 ounces in a pound.
