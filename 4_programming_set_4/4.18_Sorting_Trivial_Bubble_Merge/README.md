Write a function named sort that takes three integer parameters by reference.
The function should rearrange the parameter values so that the first parameter
gets set to the smallest value, the second parameter gets set to the second smallest
value, and the third parameter gets set to the largest value. For example, given the
variable assignments a = 30; b = 10; c = 20, the function call sort(a,b,c)
should result in a = 10, b = 20, and c = 30. Note that the array construct covered
in Chapter 5 will give you a way to solve this problem for an arbitrary number of
items instead of only for three items.

A nice addition:
- Try with quick sort
- Try with merge sort
